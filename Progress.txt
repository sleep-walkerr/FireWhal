For Next Meeting: 09/26/2025

· Build the UI to integrate all the components

· Let the daemon listen to be stopped instead of doing that manually

· In the UI, there should be all the network interfaces (like Wireshark), and the user can pick which interface the firewall rules will be applied to

· Notification messages for the blocked packets (instead of all the packets). You can still keep the log file for the admin to analyze if he/she wants

· Put the IP addresses in a file and let your app to read it instead of hardcoding inside your source code

For Next Meeting: 10/17/2025

· Build the UI to integrate all the components

· Continue the missing parts from the previous meeting (06/26/2025)

· Access control to the firewall rule file (consider later; consider read, read/write permissions on this file)

· You should have so many rules for your firewall rules
    

Progress Made:
-- Fixed issue with daemon launching components without subgroup awareness for the user running the program. This was blocking the discord bot from sending IPC messages
-- Updated firewall to load complete rules instead of just destination IP addresses. This was done using a hashmap that accepts a predefined rule structure
